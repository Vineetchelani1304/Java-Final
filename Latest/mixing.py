# Step 1: Read the audio signals from the WAV files
# Replace 'sa.wav' and 'ni.wav' with the paths to your audio files.
sample_rate_sa, audio_sa = wavfile.read("C:/Users/vinee/Downloads/Mini/old/consecutive/freqNi.wav")
sample_rate_ni, audio_ni = wavfile.read('C:/Users/vinee/Downloads/Mini/old/consecutive/freqSa.wav')

# Step 2: Ensure both signals have the same length
min_length = min(len(audio_sa), len(audio_ni))
audio_sa = audio_sa[:min_length]
audio_ni = audio_ni[:min_length]

# Step 3: Define mixing weights (gain factors)
# Adjust the weights to control the mix ratio. For equal mixing, set both to 0.5.
weight_sa = 0.5  # Weight for 'sa.wav'
weight_ni = 0.5  # Weight for 'ni.wav'

# Step 4: Mix the two audio signals mathematically
mixed_signal = (weight_sa * audio_sa) + (weight_ni * audio_ni)

# Step 5: Save the mixed audio to a new WAV file
# Replace 'mixed_output.wav' with the desired output file name.
wavfile.write('mixed_output.wav', max(sample_rate_sa, sample_rate_ni), mixed_signal.astype(np.int16))
